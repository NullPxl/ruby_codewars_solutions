### My solutions for ruby challenges on codewars.  

I've found the best way to learn a new language for me is to do a bunch of challenges on codewars until I feel comfortable doing 5 kyu, and then start a project.
* If I find and use a feature in ruby that's new to me, I'll add an explanation as a comment.
